# My Daily Calendar For Work

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a daily calender where I can schedule my tasks hourly from 9am - 5pm to keep me organized at work.

## Usage

To navigate on the web application, you can click inside any of the text areas for each hour and add your tasks. There are 3 lines in each hour. Then when you click the corresponding save button, it will save your text to your local storage. All past hours will be in grey, present hour is green, and all future hours are red.

## Application Image and Link

The following image shows the web application's appearance. You can also go to the web application by clicking the following link. https://chelleyoungw.github.io/keep-my-ducks-in-a-row
